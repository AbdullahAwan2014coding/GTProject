    <h2>History of Pakistan</h2>
    <hr width="300" align="left">
        Pakistan used to be ruled by Great Britain and was known as British India. Pakistan got <br>
    it's independance in August 14, 1947, which is also known as Pakistan Independance day. <br>
    After British India was free from Britain, India and Pakistan suffered from religous conflict. <br>
    Mohandas Gandhi wanted the <a href="islam.html" target="_blank">muslims</a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/hinduism.html" target="_blank">hindus</a> to live together peacefully, but the <br>
    muslims wanted to live seperately from the hindus. Since Mohandas Gandhi didn't want <br>
    war, they gave the muslims their own land, known as Pakistan.
