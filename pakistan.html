        <hr>
        <p>Pakistan used to be ruled by Great Britain and was known as British India. Pakistan got its independence in August 14, 1947, which is also known as Pakistan Independence Day. After British India was free from Britain, India and Pakistan suffered from religious conflict. Mohandas Gandhi wanted the <a href="images/islam.html" target="_blank">muslims</a> and <a href="images/hinduism.html" target="_blank">hindus</a> to live together peacefully, but the muslims wanted to live separately from the hindus. Since Mohandas Gandhi didn't want war, they gave the muslims their own land, known as Pakistan.</p>
