    <h2 align="center" id="History">History of Pakistan</h2>
    <hr width="300">
        <p align="center"> Pakistan gained independence on August 14, 1947, after the partition of <br>
            British India, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the All-India Muslim League. The partition <br>
            caused massive migrations and violence. After independence, Pakistan adopted a parliamentary <br>
            system, but political instability led to frequent military interventions. General Ayub Khan <br>
            seized power in 1958, initiating military rule. The 1965 war with India ended in a stalemate, <br>
            but internal tensions escalated, leading to the secession of East Pakistan and the creation <br>
            of Bangladesh in 1971 after another war with India. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto governed in the <br>
            1970s but was overthrown by General Zia-ul-Haq, who enforced Islamic laws. His rule ended <br>
            with his death in 1988, leading to a democratic period under Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif. <br>
            Another military coup in 1999 brought General Pervez Musharraf to power until democracy <br>
            was restored in 2008. In 2018, Imran Khan became Prime Minister but was removed in 2022 <br>
            amid political turmoil. Pakistan's history reflects resilience amid challenges, from <br>
            political instability to economic struggles. Its future depends on strengthening democracy, <br>
            economic reforms, and social development. With a young population and strategic importance, <br>
            Pakistan has the potential for growth. Stability, good governance, and innovation will be key <br>
            to shaping a prosperous and sustainable future.</p>

And Peoples Refrains
You are Enough For Me.
Fulfil my Destiny.

I Could not see the way was Hid.
My Heart Gives Solace
To wishes unfulfilled
I Dot on you , I Call Out You Name
Lets have it out, For Shame.

My Love what of this Distance
My Love, Dont let This Distance Reign.
Dont Let these lovers be in pain
Dont Let these lovers be in pain
Come, let's go, taking you along, there are chains of worlds
You are there, you are lacking
Create it, decorate it, give us refuge
Create it, decorate it, give us refuge
Set fire to You Worries
