    <h2 align="center">History of the U.S</h2>
    <hr width="300">
        The U.S all began when British decided to settle to the "new land". British was competing with the other European <br>
    countries for land and power. Each country wanted the most. So Great Britan decided to settle in America. America's <br>
    first settle ment was Jamestown, Virginia. The settlement didn't work out well, and ended in war between the settlers <br>
    and the natives. Then, more and more people came to America, and they were unhappy about the way the British were <br>
    treating them. In fact, the revolutionary war had many causes, such as taxes, no taxtaion with out representation, <br>
    and some act, like the Boston Tea Party and the Boston Massacre. People were extremely unhappy abot the way the British <br>
    were treating them. They started telling people they should break of from Great Britan! That was what started the <br>
    Revolutionary War, which ended in U.S victory at the battle of Yorktown, where they celebrated by playing Yankee <br>
    Doodle, the song the British used to mock americans! Now that's karma! The U.S signed the Treaty of Paris, which <br>
    stated that the U.S would become it's own country, and that it would expand towards the Mississipi River. Now, <br>
    you're probaly wondering, how did the U.S get bigger then? Well, the Louisiana Purchase is how! The US wanted to <br>
    buy New Oreland, so they could have access to the Port of New Oreland. Now, the problem was, France owned the land <br>
    at the time, but they managed to strike a deal. The US said we would buy New Oreland for $10 million! France, who <br>
    had just been in a war, needed the money, and wanted to go home, said they would give them all of their land for <br>
    $15 million dollers. The US said yes, and France had enough money to pay off their debts and go home, while the US <br>
    doubled in size!</p>
