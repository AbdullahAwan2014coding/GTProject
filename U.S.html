    <h2 align="center">History of the U.S</h2>
    <hr width="300"><p align="center">
    The United States traces its origins to the 13 British colonies established along the East Coast in the 17th <br>
    and 18th centuries. Tensions between the colonies and Britain grew over taxation and governance, leading to the <br>
    American Revolution (1775–1783). On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence, primarily authored by Thomas <br>
    Jefferson, was adopted, proclaiming the colonies' separation from Britain and asserting the principles of liberty <br>
    and self-governance. After winning independence in 1783, the U.S. adopted the Constitution in 1787, creating a <br>
    federal government with a system of checks and balances. The country expanded westward, survived a civil war (1861 <br>
    –1865) over slavery, and emerged as a major industrial power in the late 19th century. The 20th century saw the U.S. <br>
    playing a decisive role in both World Wars, enduring the Great Depression, and leading the Cold War against the Soviet <br>
    Union. Landmark movements like the Civil Rights Movement (1950s–1960s) advanced equality. Today, the U.S. stands as a <br>
    global leader in economy, science, and culture. Its history is a story of resilience, innovation, and the ongoing pursuit <br>
    of the ideals set forth in 1776.</p>
<h2 align="center">Breif Description and Geography</h2>
