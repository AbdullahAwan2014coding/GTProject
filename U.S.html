    <h2 align="center">History of the U.S</h2>
    <hr width="300"><p align="center">
    The United States traces its origins to the 13 British colonies established along the East Coast in the 17th <br>
    and 18th centuries. Tensions between the colonies and Britain grew over taxation and governance, leading to the <br>
    American Revolution (1775–1783). On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence, primarily authored by Thomas <br>
    Jefferson, was adopted, proclaiming the colonies' separation from Britain and asserting the principles of liberty <br>
    and self-governance. After winning independence in 1783, the U.S. adopted the Constitution in 1787, creating a <br>
    federal government with a system of checks and balances. The country expanded westward, survived a civil war (1861 <br>
    –1865) over slavery, and emerged as a major industrial power in the late 19th century. The 20th century saw the U.S. <br>
    playing a decisive role in both World Wars, enduring the Great Depression, and leading the Cold War against the Soviet <br>
    Union. Landmark movements like the Civil Rights Movement (1950s–1960s) advanced equality. Today, the U.S. stands as a <br>
    global leader in economy, science, and culture. Its history is a story of resilience, innovation, and the ongoing pursuit <br>
    of the ideals set forth in 1776.</p>
<h2 align="center">Breif Description and Geography</h2>
<hr width="300"> <p align="center">
    The United States of America (U.S.) is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district <br>
    (Washington, D.C.), and several territories. It is one of the world's largest and most influential <br>
    countries, known for its economic power, technological advancements, and cultural diversity, with a <br>
    population of over 330 million. Covering approximately 9.8 million square kilometers (3.8 million <br>
    square miles), it is the third-largest country by land area after Russia and Canada. The U.S. is <br>
    bordered by Canada to the north, Mexico to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Pacific <br>
    Ocean to the west. Its geography is diverse, featuring major mountain ranges such as the Rockies, Appalachians, <br>
    and Sierra Nevada, as well as vast plains, plateaus, and deserts like the Great Plains, Colorado <br>
    Plateau, Mojave Desert, and Great Basin. The country is home to significant bodies of water, including <br>
    the Great Lakes and major rivers such as the Mississippi, Missouri, and Colorado. The U.S. experiences a <br>
    wide range of climate zones, from the tropical conditions of Hawaii and Florida to the arid landscapes of the <br>
    Southwest, the temperate regions of the East Coast and Midwest, the continental climate of the northern states, <br>
    and the arctic conditions of Alaska. The country also includes the geographically distinct states of Alaska, located <br>
    northwest of Canada, and Hawaii, an island chain in the Pacific. This vast and varied geography contributes to its <br>
    rich natural resources and diverse ecosystems.</p>
